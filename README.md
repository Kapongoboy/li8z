# Li8Z

Hey, this is **Li8Z**, an attempt at implementing a Chip-8 emulator in Ziglang.
I was inspired to try this project thanks to my
[buddy](https://github.com/kevin-nel).  The project will be heavily guided by
this beautiful [guide](https://github.com/aquova/chip8-book).  When I feel the
project is complete I will tag a release, until then thank you for reading and
hope you are well.
